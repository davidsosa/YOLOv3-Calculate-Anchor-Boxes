# Calculate Anchor Boxes Using Gaussian Mixture Models for Yolo V3

This script performs K-means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models on the Berkeley Deep Drive dataset to find the appropriate anchor boxes for YOLOv3. You can download the dataset and json file that contains labels from here
https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/

Originally Yolov3 has 9 anchor boxes and default image size is 608x608.You can adapt it to your own dataset.
For any issues please let me know.
